#summary Notes on the integration with QFLan.

= MultiVeStA for the Analysis of probabilistic models of Software Product Lines with Quantitative Constraints =

QFlan is a probabilistic feature-oriented language to specify models of software product lines with probabilistic configurations and behaviour, e.g. by considering a QFLan semantics based on discrete-time Markov chains. Quantitative constraints can affect products generated by QFLan models, like "bikes can have a certain maximum price and weight", "bikes without an engine can weigh at most 10 kg" or "only bikes costing more than 250 euros can be sold".

A prototypal Maude implementation of QFLan exists, combined with the state-of-the-art Microsoft's SMT solver [http://z3.codeplex.com/ Z3]

The QFLAN interpreter  has been combined with MultiVeStA to perform quantitative analyses of software product lines. 

The integration is discussed in detail in a draft submitted at the [http://www.splc2015.net/ 19th International Software Product Line Conference] ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/qty17idt76lbaie/SPLC15.pdf?dl=0 draft]). 

In the paper, the integration has been exploited to analyse a bikes product line. The presented analyses include the likelihood of certain behaviour of interest (e.g. disposal of broken bike), the expected average cost and weight of bikes, and the probability of install and uninstall certain features.

A ready to use version of MultiVeStA integrating QFLan is available [MISSINGLINK here] together with all files necessary to reproduce the experiments discussed in the draft.
