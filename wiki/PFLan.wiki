#summary Notes on the integration with PFlan.

= MultiVeStA for the quantitative analysis of software product lines =

PFlan is a probabilistic feature-oriented language to specify models of software product lines with probabilistic configurations and behaviour, e.g. by considering a PFLan semantics based on discrete-time Markov chains. 

The (Maude) implementation of PFLAN has been combined with MultiVeStA to perform quantitative analyses of software product lines. 

The integration has been presented at the [http://fmsple15.isti.cnr.it/ 6th Workshop on Formal Methods and Analysis in SPL Engineering] ([https://www.dropbox.com/s/ksa5brtj3p5c75x/FMSPLE.pdf?dl=0 draft]). 

In the paper, the integration has been exploited to analyse a simple product line case study. The presented analyses include the likelihood of certain behaviour of interest (e.g. product malfunctioning) and the expected average cost of products.

A ready to use version of MultiVeStA integrating PFLan is available [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2zi0m6b5rfx9nfd/distrFMSPLE2015.zip?dl=0 here] togheter with all files necessary to reproduce the experiments discussed in the paper.
