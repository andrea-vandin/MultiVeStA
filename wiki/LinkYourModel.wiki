= Link your simulation model to MultiVeStA =

Here are described the steps that must be followed before analyze your model using MultiVeStA. However, if you have a simulator, and you want to enrich it with efficient, distributed and automated statistical analysis techniques, just send an e-mail to us, and we will be happy collaborate to the integration. 


== Implement model specific state evaluation ==

Often analyzing a model is required to make observations that are model specific and thus can not be defined in the _NewState_ class extension done by your simulator, e.g., count the number of robots collisions, evaluate the time spent by a task in queue, etc.

To do this can be needed implements the _*IStateEvaluator*_ for your model. This class is constituted by only one method _*getVal( int observation , NewState state )*_ called by your _NewState_ when the observation are model specific.
This method takes the current simulation state (_state_) and the observation of interest (_observation_) and must analyze the current state returning a _double_ corresponding to the propery of interest.


== Define the MultiQuaTEx expressions ==
The system properties of interest can be encoded using the basic QuaTEx Language or its extended version in MultiQuaTEx that adds support to parametric and multi -query.
