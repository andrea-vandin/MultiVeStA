#summary Parameter supported by the MultiVeStA client.

= MultiVeStA client =

In the following are described the parameters through which is possible to describe the MultiVeStA behavior.

   * _*m*_ simulation model name
   * _*l*_ file name with server list. The file is constituted by row in the format _ipAddress:port_, where each row is the reference to a server
   * _*se*_ Java class of the state evaluator. Used to compute the model-specific state observation
   * _*f*_ file containing the MultiQuaTEx expression to be evaluated
   * _*bs*_ _simulations block size_ specifies the number of simulations performed at each iteration
   * _*a*_ define the alpha parameter for the required Confidence Interval
   * _*d1*_ define the delta parameter for the required Confidence Interval
   * _*osws*_ _one step or whole simulation_ define if the simulation must be performed step-by_step (ONESTEP) or until the simulation met an internal halting condition (WHOLESIMULATION)
   * _*sots*_ root seed used to generate (using the Mersenne Twister algorithm) the seeds required to initialize all the simulations
   * _*sd*_ Java class specifying the state evaluator (the class that extends the MultiVeStA _NewState_)
   * _*ms*_ maximum number of performed simulations independently if the required Confidence Interval is reached
   * _*ds*_ _delta list_ useful if the evaluated expressions provide values that differ in order of magnitude
   * _*vp*_ to visualize or not the gui plot for MultiQuaTEx parametric expression (default is true)
